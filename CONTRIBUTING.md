# Contributing to BioViewer

We love your input! We want to make contributing to BioViewer as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
2. Update the package.json version number in a commit by itself.
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer.

## Commit Guidelines

We use Commitizen for standardized commit messages. Instead of using `git commit`, please use either:

```bash
npm run commit
```

or

```bash
npx cz
```

This will launch an interactive prompt to help you create a standardized commit message. The commit message format follows the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), which helps maintain a clear and standardized git history.

## Any Contributions You Make Will Be Under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report Bugs Using GitHub's [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/shuuul/bioviewer/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/shuuul/bioviewer/issues/new).

## Write Bug Reports With Detail, Background, and Sample Code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Use TypeScript for all source files
* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Use descriptive variable names
* Comment your code where necessary

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
